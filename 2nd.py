# Example
#  A dictionary which represents the top rankings for men's Football teams and how many games they won out of 9.
table = {"Arsenal": 8, "Man City": 7, "Totenhum": 6, "Chelsea": 5, "Man United": 5}

# use a 'for loop' and the 'items()' method to go through each of the key value pairs of the 'table' dictionary.
for team, score in table.items():
    print(f"{team:10} ==> {score:10d}")
# {team:10} and {score:10d} tells the computer to create a field that is 10 characters wide. This will create even columns for the data. 'd' inside here {score:10d} refers to a decimal integer.


# Template string
# import the template library -> 'from string import Template'
# Template("$placeholder").substitute(placeholder="value")
from string import Template

print(Template("I love $name!").substitute(name="python"))

#  ' = ' to place the plus/minus sign at the left most position

#  ' + ' to always indicate if the number is positive or negative
txt5 = "The temperature is between {:+} and {:+} degrees celsius."

#  ' ' (a space) to insert a space before positive numbers and a minus sign before negative numbers
txt7 = "The temperature is between {: } and {: } degrees celsius."
print(txt7.format(-3, 7))

#  ' , ' to add a comma as a thousand separator
txt8 = "The universe is {:,} years old."

#  ' _ ' to add a underscore character as a thousand separator
txt9 = "The universe is {:_} years old."

#  ' b ' to convert the number into binary format
txt10 = "The binary version of {0} is {0:b}"

#  ' d ' to convert a number, in this case a binary number, into decimal number format
txt11 = "We have {:d} chickens."

#  ' e ' to convert a number into scientific number format (with a lower-case e)

#  ' E ' to convert a number into scientific number format (with an upper-case E)
txt13 = "We have {:E} chickens."

#  ' f ' to convert a number into a fixed point number, default with 6 decimals, but use a period followed by a number to specify the number of decimals

#same example, but with a lower case f

#  ' o ' to convert the number into octal format
txt18 = "The octal version of {0} is {0:o}"

#  ' x ' to convert the number into Hex format:
txt19 = "The Hexadecimal version of {0} is {0:x}"

#  ' X ' to convert the number into upper-case Hex format:
